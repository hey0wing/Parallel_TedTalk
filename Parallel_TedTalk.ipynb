            " Behold the human brain, it's lumpy landscape visibly split into a left and right side. This structure has inspired one of  the most pervasive ideas about the brain, that the left side controls logic and the right, creativity. And yet, this is a myth unsupported by scientific evidence. So how did this misleading idea come about, and what does it get wrong? It's true that the brain has a right and a left side. This is most apparent  with the outer layer, or the cortex. Internal regions, like the striatum, hypothalamus, thalamus, and brain stem appear to be made from continuous tissue, but in fact, they're also organized with left and right sides. The left and the right sides of the brain do control different body functions, such as movement and sight. The brain's right side controls the motion of the left arm and leg and vice versa. The visual system is even more complex. Each eye has a left  and right visual field. Both left visual fields are sent to the right side of the brain, and both right fields  are sent to the left side. So the brain uses both sides to make a complete image of the world. Scientists don't know for sure why we have that crossing over. One theory is it began soon after animals developed more complex nervous systems because it gave the survival advantage of quicker reflexes. If an animal sees a predator coming from its left side, it's best off escaping to the right. So we can say that vision  and movement control are two systems that rely on this left-right structure, but problems arise when we over-extend that idea to logic and creativity. This misconception began in  the mid-1800s when two neurologists, Broca and Wernicke, examined patients who had problems communicating due to injuries. The researchers found damage to the patients' left temporal lobes, so they suggested that language is controlled by the left side of the brain. That captured the popular imagination. Author Robert Louis Stevenson then introduced the idea  of a logical left hemisphere competing with an emotional  right hemisphere represented by his characters Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. But this idea didn't hold up when doctors and scientists examined patients who were missing a hemisphere or had their two hemispheres separated. These patients showed a complete range of behaviors, both logical and creative. Later research showed that one side of the brain is more active than the other for some functions. Language is more localized to the left and attention to the right. So one side of the brain may do more work, but this varies by system rather than by person. There isn't any evidence to suggest that individuals have dominant  sides of the brain, or to support the idea  of a left-right split between logic and creativity. Some people may be particularly logical or creative, but that has nothing to do with the sides of their brains. And even the idea of logic and creativity being at odds with each other doesn't hold up well. Solving complex math problems requires inspired creativity and many vibrant works of art have intricate logical frameworks. Almost every feat of creativity and logic carries the mark of the whole brain functioning as one. \n",

This strategy is now known as \"dogfooding,\" and it's a common strategy in the business world. It doesn't mean everyone goes in and eats dog food, but businesspeople will use their own products to demonstrate that they feel — that they're confident in them. Now, this is a widespread practice, but I think what's really interesting is when you find exceptions to this rule, when you find cases of businesses or people in businesses who don't use their own products. Turns out there's one industry where this happens in a common way, in a pretty regular way, and that is the screen-based tech industry. \n",

            " Deep inside Yale University's Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library lies the only copy of a 240-page tome. Recently carbon dated to around 1420, its vellum pages features  looping handwriting and hand-drawn images seemingly stolen from a dream. Real and imaginary plants, floating castles, bathing women, astrology diagrams, zodiac rings, and suns and moons with faces accompany the text. This 24x16 centimeter book is called the Voynich manuscript, and its one of history's biggest unsolved mysteries. The reason why? No one can figure out what it says. The name comes from Wilfrid Voynich, a Polish bookseller who came across the document at a Jesuit college in Italy in 1912. He was puzzled. Who wrote it? Where was it made? What do these bizarre words and vibrant drawings represent? What secrets do its pages contain? He purchased the manuscript from the cash-strapped priest at the college, and eventually brought it to the U.S., where experts have continued to puzzle over it for more than a century. Cryptologists say the writing has all the characteristics of a real language, just one that no one's ever seen before. What makes it seem real is that in actual languages, letters and groups of letters appear with consistent frequencies, and the language in the Voynich manuscript has patterns you wouldn't find from a random letter generator. Other than that, we know little more than what we can see. The letters are varied  in style and height. Some are borrowed from other scripts, but many are unique. The taller letters have been named gallows characters. The manuscript is  highly decorated throughout with scroll-like embellishments. It appears to be written by two or more hands, with the painting done  by yet another party. Over the years, three main theories about the manuscript's text have emerged. The first is that it's written in cypher, a secret code deliberately designed to hide secret meaning. The second is that the document is a hoax written in gibberish to make money off a gullible buyer. Some speculate the author was a medieval con man. Others, that it was Voynich himself. The third theory is that the manuscript is written in an actual language, but in an unknown script. Perhaps medieval scholars were attempting to create an alphabet for a language that was spoken but not yet written. In that case, the Voynich manuscript might be like the rongorongo script invented on Easter Island, now unreadable after the culture that made it collapsed. Though no one can read  the Voynich manuscript, that hasn't stopped people from guessing what it might say. Those who believe the manuscript was an attempt to create a new form of written language speculate that it might be an encyclopedia containing the knowledge  of the culture that produced it. Others believe it was written by  the 13th century philosopher Roger Bacon, who attempted to understand  the universal laws of grammar, or in the 16th century by the Elizabethan mystic John Dee, who practiced alchemy and divination. More fringe theories that the book was written by a coven of Italian witches, or even by Martians. After 100 years of frustration, scientists have recently shed a little light on the mystery. The first breakthrough  was the carbon dating. Also, contemporary historians have traced the provenance of the manuscript back through Rome and Prague to as early as 1612, when it was perhaps passed from Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II to his physician, Jacobus Sinapius. In addition to these  historical breakthroughs, linguistic researchers recently proposed the provisional identification of a few of the manuscript's words. Could the letters beside these seven stars spell Tauran, a name for Taurus, a constellation that includes the seven stars called the Pleiades? Could this word be Centaurun for the Centaurea plant in the picture? Perhaps, but progress is slow. If we can crack its code, what might we find? The dream journal of  a 15th-century illustrator? A bunch of nonsense? Or the lost knowledge  of a forgotten culture? What do you think it is? \n",

They taught me that the only way to get the right answers is to ask the right questions. So what are the right questions when it comes to improving the educational outcomes for our children? There's obviously many important questions, but I think the following is a good place to start: What do we think the connection is between a child's growing mind and their growing body? What can we expect our kids to learn if their diets are full of sugar and empty of nutrients? What can they possibly learn if their bodies are literally going hungry? And with all the resources that we are pouring into schools, we should stop and ask ourselves: Are we really setting our kids up for success? \n",

            " In 1956, during a diplomatic  reception in Moscow, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev told Western Bloc ambassadors, \"My vas pokhoronim!\" His interpreter rendered that into English as, \"We will bury you!\" This statement sent shockwaves through the Western world, heightening the tension between the Soviet Union and the US who were in the thick of the Cold War. Some believe this incident alone set East/West relations back a decade. As it turns out, Khrushchev's remark was translated a bit too literally. Given the context, his words should have been rendered as, \"We will live to see you buried,\" meaning that Communism  would outlast Capitalism, a less threatening comment. Though the intended meaning was eventually clarified, the initial impact of Khrushchev's apparent words put the world on a path that could have led to nuclear armageddon. So now, given the complexities of language and cultural exchange, how does this sort of thing not happen all the time? Much of the answer lies with the skill and training of interpreters to overcome language barriers. For most of history, interpretation was mainly done consecutively, with speakers and interpreters making pauses to allow each other to speak. But after the advent of radio technology, a new simultaneous interpretations system was developed in the wake of World War II. In the simultaneous mode interpreters instantaneously  translate a speaker's words into a microphone while he speaks. Without pauses, those in the audience can choose the language in which they want to follow. On the surface, it all looks seamless, but behind the scenes, human interpreters work incessantly  to ensure every idea  gets across as intended. And that is no easy task. It takes about two years of training for already fluent bilingual professionals to expand their vocabulary  and master the skills necessary to become a conference interpreter. To get used to the unnatural task of speaking while they listen, students shadow speakers and repeat their every word  exactly as heard in the same language. In time, they begin to paraphrase  what is said, making stylistic adjustments as they go. At some point, a second language is introduced. Practicing in this way creates new neural pathways in the interpreter's brain, and the constant effort of reformulation gradually becomes second nature. Over time and through much hard work, the interpreter masters a vast array  of tricks to keep up with speed, deal with challenging terminology, and handle a multitude of foreign accents. They may resort to acronyms  to shorten long names, choose generic terms over specific, or refer to slides and other visual aides. They can even leave a term  in the original language, while they search for the most  accurate equivalent. Interpreters are also skilled at keeping aplomb in the face of chaos. Remember, they have no control over who is going to say what, or how articulate the speaker will sound. A curveball can be thrown at any time. Also, they often perform  to thousands of people and in very intimidating settings, like the UN General Assembly. To keep their emotions in check, they carefully prepare for an assignment, building glossaries in advance, reading voraciously  about the subject matter, and reviewing previous talks on the topic. Finally, interpreters work in pairs. While one colleague is busy translating incoming speeches in real time, the other gives support  by locating documents, looking up words, and tracking down pertinent information. Because simultaneous interpretation requires intense concentration, every 30 minutes, the pair switches roles. Success is heavily dependent  on skillful collaboration. Language is complex, and when abstract or nuanced concepts get lost in translation, the consequences may be catastrophic. As Margaret Atwood famously noted, \"War is what happens when language fails.\" Conference interpreters of all people are aware of that and work diligently behind the scenes to make sure it never does. \n",

            " Late in January 1975, a 17-year-old German girl called Vera Brandes walked out onto the stage of the Cologne Opera House. The auditorium was empty. It was lit only by the dim, green glow of the emergency exit sign. This was the most exciting day of Vera's life. She was the youngest concert promoter in Germany, and she had persuaded the Cologne Opera House to host a late-night concert of jazz from the American musician, Keith Jarrett. 1,400 people were coming. And in just a few hours, Jarrett would walk out on the same stage, he'd sit down at the piano and without rehearsal or sheet music, he would begin to play. \n",

            " This may look like a neatly arranged stack of numbers, but it's actually a mathematical treasure trove. Indian mathematicians called it  the Staircase of Mount Meru. In Iran, it's the Khayyam Triangle. And in China, it's Yang Hui's Triangle. To much of the Western world, it's known as Pascal's Triangle after French mathematician Blaise Pascal, which seems a bit unfair since he was clearly late to the party, but he still had a lot to contribute. So what is it about this that has so  intrigued mathematicians the world over? In short,  it's full of patterns and secrets. First and foremost, there's the pattern that generates it. Start with one and imagine invisible zeros on either side of it. Add them together in pairs,  and you'll generate the next row. Now, do that again and again. Keep going and you'll wind up  with something like this, though really Pascal's Triangle  goes on infinitely. Now, each row corresponds to what's called the coefficients of a binomial expansion of the form (x+y)^n, where n is the number of the row, and we start counting from zero. So if you make n=2 and expand it, you get (x^2) + 2xy + (y^2). The coefficients,  or numbers in front of the variables, are the same as the numbers in that row of Pascal's Triangle. You'll see the same thing with n=3, which expands to this. So the triangle is a quick and easy way to look up all of these coefficients. But there's much more. For example, add up  the numbers in each row, and you'll get successive powers of two. Or in a given row, treat each number as part of a decimal expansion. In other words, row two is (1x1) + (2x10) + (1x100). You get 121, which is 11^2. And take a look at what happens when you do the same thing to row six. It adds up to 1,771,561, which is 11^6, and so on. There are also geometric applications. Look at the diagonals. The first two aren't very interesting: all ones, and then the positive integers, also known as natural numbers. But the numbers in the next diagonal are called the triangular numbers because if you take that many dots, you can stack them  into equilateral triangles. The next diagonal  has the tetrahedral numbers because similarly, you can stack that many spheres into tetrahedra. Or how about this: shade in all of the odd numbers. It doesn't look like much when the triangle's small, but if you add thousands of rows, you get a fractal  known as Sierpinski's Triangle. This triangle isn't just  a mathematical work of art. It's also quite useful, especially when it comes  to probability and calculations in the domain of combinatorics. Say you want to have five children, and would like to know the probability of having your dream family  of three girls and two boys. In the binomial expansion, that corresponds  to girl plus boy to the fifth power. So we look at the row five, where the first number  corresponds to five girls, and the last corresponds to five boys. The third number  is what we're looking for. Ten out of the sum  of all the possibilities in the row. so 10/32, or 31.25%. Or, if you're randomly  picking a five-player basketball team out of a group of twelve friends, how many possible groups  of five are there? In combinatoric terms, this problem would be phrased as twelve choose five, and could be calculated with this formula, or you could just look at the sixth  element of row twelve on the triangle and get your answer. The patterns in Pascal's Triangle are a testament to the elegantly  interwoven fabric of mathematics. And it's still revealing fresh secrets to this day. For example, mathematicians recently  discovered a way to expand it to these kinds of polynomials. What might we find next? Well, that's up to you. \n",

            " We hear about calories all the time. How many calories are in this cookie? How many are burned by 100 jumping jacks, or long distance running, or fidgeting? But what is a calorie, really, and how many of them do we actually need? Calories are a way of keeping track of the body's energy budget. A healthy balance occurs when we put in about as much energy as we lose. If we consistently put more energy into our bodies than we burn, the excess will gradually  be stored as fat in our cells, and we'll gain weight. If we burn off more energy  than we replenish, we'll lose weight. So we have to be able  to measure the energy we consume and use, and we do so with a unit  called the calorie. One calorie, the kind we measure in food, also called a large calorie, is defined as the amount of energy it would take to raise the temperature of one kilogram of water by one degree Celsius. Everything we consume has a calorie count, a measure of how much energy  the item stores in its chemical bonds. The average pizza slice has 272 calories, there are about 78 in a piece of bread, and an apple has about 52. That energy is released during digestion, and stored in other molecules that can be broken down to provide energy when the body needs it. It's used in three ways: about 10% enables digestion, about 20% fuels physical activity, and the biggest chunk, around 70%, supports the basic functions  of our organs and tissues. That third usage corresponds to  your basal metabolic rate, a number of calories  you would need to survive if you weren't eating or moving around. Add in some physical activity  and digestion, and you arrive at the official guidelines for how many calories  the average person requires each day: 2000 for women and 2500 for men. Those estimates are based on factors like average weight, physical activity  and muscle mass. So does that mean everyone should shoot for around 2000 calories? Not necessarily. If you're doing  an energy guzzling activity, like cycling the Tour de France, your body could use  up to 9000 calories per day. Pregnancy requires  slightly more calories than usual, and elderly people typically  have a slower metabolic rate, energy is burned more gradually, so less is needed. Here's something else you should know before you start counting calories. The calorie counts on nutrition labels measure how much energy the food contains, not how much energy  you can actually get out of it. Fibrous foods like celery and whole wheat take more energy to digest, so you'd actually wind up with less energy from a 100 calorie serving of celery than a 100 calorie serving  of potato chips. Not to mention the fact that some foods offer nutrients like protein and vitamins, while others provide  far less nutritional value. Eating too many of those foods could leave you overweight  and malnourished. And even with the exact same food, different people might not  get the same number of calories. Variations in things like enzyme levels, gut bacteria, and even intestine length, means that every individual's ability to extract energy from food is a little different. So a calorie is a useful energy measure, but to work out exactly  how many of them each of us requires we need to factor in things like exercise, food type, and our body's ability to process energy. Good luck finding all of that on a nutrition label. \n",

Because it was a line from our Chinese parallel Susan Boyle — a 50-some year-old woman, a vegetable vendor in Shanghai, who loves singing Western opera, but she didn't understand any English or French or Italian, so she managed to fill in the lyrics with vegetable names in Chinese. (Laughter) And the last sentence of Nessun Dorma that she was singing in the stadium was \"green onion for free.\" So [as] Susan Boyle was saying that, 80,000 live audience sang together.

You're not RoboCop, and you're not Terminator, but you're cyborgs every time you look at a computer screen or use one of your cell phone devices. So what's a good definition for cyborg? Well, traditional definition is \"an organism to which exogenous components have been added for the purpose of adapting to new environments.\" That came from a 1960 paper on space travel, because, if you think about it, space is pretty awkward. People aren't supposed to be there. But humans are curious, and they like to add things to their bodies so they can go to the Alps one day and then become a fish in the sea the next. \n",
